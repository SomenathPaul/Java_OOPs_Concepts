# 🛡️ Encapsulation in Java (Pillar 1)

🔹 Definition
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together into a single unit (class).
It’s like putting sensitive data inside a capsule and controlling how the outside world accesses it.

🔹 Key Rules
Make class variables private (so they can’t be accessed directly).
Provide public getters and setters to access and update the values safely.
Optionally, apply validation inside setters.

🔹 Real-World Analogy
Think of a Bank ATM:
You can’t directly access the cash inside → it’s protected.
You interact only through the ATM interface (getters/setters) → safe access.
