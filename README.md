# Java_OOPs_Concepts
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. It includes detailed explanations, practical examples, and small projects demonstrating core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

# üèóÔ∏è Order to Study the 4 OOP Pillars in Java <br>

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Encapsulation (Start Here)
Why first? ‚Üí It‚Äôs the foundation. Everything in OOP is about bundling data + methods together inside a class.<br>
What to learn?<br>
private fields, getters & setters<br>
Access modifiers (private, public, protected)<br>
Example: BankAccount with deposit/withdraw methods.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Inheritance (Next Step)
Why second? ‚Üí Once you know classes/objects (via encapsulation), inheritance teaches code reusability and parent-child relationships.<br>
What to learn?<br>
extends, super keyword<br>
Constructor chaining<br>
Types: single, multilevel, hierarchical (Java doesn‚Äôt allow multiple with classes).<br>
Example: Vehicle ‚Üí Car, Bike.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Polymorphism (After Inheritance)
Why third? ‚Üí Inheritance naturally leads to overriding methods (runtime polymorphism). It shows how the same method name can behave differently.<br>
What to learn?<br>
Method overloading (compile-time polymorphism)<br>
Method overriding (runtime polymorphism)<br>
Dynamic Method Dispatch (Parent ref = new Child())<br>
Example: Animal ‚Üí Dog and Cat both override makeSound().

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Abstraction (Last)
Why last? ‚Üí Abstraction is a higher-level concept that builds on encapsulation + inheritance + polymorphism.<br>
What to learn?<br>
Abstract classes & methods<br>
Interfaces (implements, Java 8+: default & static methods, Java 9+: private methods)<br>
Multiple inheritance with interfaces<br>
Example: Shape (abstract) ‚Üí Circle, Rectangle implement area().

# üîë Final Suggested Learning Flow:
Encapsulation ‚Üí Inheritance ‚Üí Polymorphism ‚Üí Abstraction<br>
After that, explore advanced OOP: inner classes, final, this, super, Object class methods, etc.<br>
Apply them in mini-projects (Banking System, Student Management, Library System).
